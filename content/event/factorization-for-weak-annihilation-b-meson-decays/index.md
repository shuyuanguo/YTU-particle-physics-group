title: Factorization for weak annihilation B-meson decays
abstract: It is generally accepted that the exclusive two-body charmless
  bottom-meson decays are of fundamental importance for advancing our
  understanding towards diverse facets of the strong interaction dynamics
  governing the flavour-changing heavy-quark decay processes and for exploring
  the peculiar implications of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism for CP
  violation in electroweak interactions. In this talk I will report on the
  field-theoretical computation of the weak annihilation contribution to the
  non-leptonic B-meson decay by resolving the outstanding problem of eliminating
  the end-point divergences in the conventional soft-collinear factorization
  formulae, which is imperative to push forward the precision description of
  heavy quark hadron decay processes demanded by the dedicated flavour physics
  programme of LHCb and Belle II.
