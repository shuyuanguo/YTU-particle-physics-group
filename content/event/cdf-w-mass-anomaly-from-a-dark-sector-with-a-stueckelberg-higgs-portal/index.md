title: CDF W mass anomaly from a dark sector with a Stueckelberg-Higgs portal
abstract: We propose an explanation to the new W mass measurement recently
  reported by the CDF collaboration, which is larger than the standard model
  expectation by about 7 standard deviations. To alleviate the tensions that are
  imposed on the electroweak sector by the new W mass measurement, we carry out
  an analysis in the Stueckelberg extended standard model where a new neutral
  gauge boson appears which mixes with the two neutral gauge bosons in the
  electroweak sector both via the Stueckelberg mass terms and via the gauge
  invariant Stueckelberg-Higgs portal interaction and spoils the custodial
  symmetry at the tree level so that the simple relation between the W boson
  mass and the Z boson mass does not hold. We find that such an extension
  increases the W boson mass if the new gauge boson mass is larger than the Z
  boson mass. We further show that there exists a significant part of the
  parameter space in the extended model which includes the CDF mass anomaly and
  is consistent with the various observables at the Z pole and consistent with
  the ATLAS dilepton limits. The Stueckelberg Z' boson, which resolves the CDF W
  mass anomaly, should be searchable in future LHC experiments.
